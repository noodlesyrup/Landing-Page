            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>
              One Piece is a manga and anime series that follows Monkey D.
              Luffy, a young boy with a dream to become the greatest pirate in
              the world. As a child, he eats a mystical plant called a Devil
              Fruit that grants him the power to stretch like rubber. The series
              starts as Luffy ventures out into the world for the first time and
              starts to amass a crew of pirates. The main group grows over time
              but starts with the founding members of Luffy, Nami the navigator,
              and a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro (localized as Zolo in some
              Western versions of comic). Eventually, Luffy and his crew become
              known as the Straw Hat Pirates, and his posse undertakes a series
              of swashbuckling adventures across the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              Much of the joy of One Piece comes from its whimsy. Throughout the
              series, Luffy travels the world from island to island, each with
              its own setting and theme. It’s a rather fantastical world filled
              with anthropomorphized animals, living skeletons, and more
              delightfully odd beings. One moment the crew will be in a winter
              wonderland; the next, a tropical isle populated by giants. The
              series bursts with silly and colorful details: Zoro wields a sword
              with his mouth, a fearsome military leader wears a cute bulldog
              hat, and characters don’t talk with phones, but rather via special
              “transponder snails” that can send and receive messages. Luffy
              himself is a carefree spirit; he just wants to devour a
              scrumptious meal, and loves some good potty humor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the more lighthearted elements of the series, much of One
              Piece centers around themes of liberation. Over the course of his
              adventures, Luffy often takes up arms in support of his friends
              and inspires others to rise up against pirate oppressors and
              state-sanctioned military occupations alike. Typical to the
              conventions of a shonen manga, Luffy and the crew grow stronger
              and stronger with each subsequent fight. A lot of the story
              focuses on the moments where Luffy overcomes a seemingly
              insurmountable challenge and unearths some sort of hidden power.
              Gradually, these fights strengthen Luffy and his crew and take
              them closer to his end goal of finding the One Piece.
